## 📝 Note

These dotfiles are tailored for my personal Arch Linux setup using **Hyprland** on **Wayland**,  
with a focus on a clean, themed, and lightweight environment.  
Everything is configured manually and reproducibly through a script that installs packages and applies theming.

The goal here is to have a **custom system that reflects my workflow and aesthetic**, while keeping it minimal and efficient.  
The file `packages.txt` documents what each package is used for — and only what's truly needed stays.

Feel free to use this as reference, but keep in mind this is a personal project.

## 🌸

This was my **first rice**, and it was a really fun experience to build and shape it from scratch.  
My goal was to have only what I need, with full control over every detail — it's my space, my environment.  
If you found something useful here or decide to use any part of it, I hope you enjoy it too —  
**like a cozy forest spirit taking care of things.**
